# Lunar Tiny C Compiler

Just a toy compiler.
The purpose of the project is to help me learn the principles of compilation, and the modular design is inspired by LLVM.

Under development....

## Goals
* Being able to compile **C Source Code** into assembly code.
* Implement few independent optimizations.
